    <ingredients>
        <ol type:i>
            <strong>1 cup</strong> natural peanut butter (270g), creamy or crunchy (or almond butter)
            <br>
            <strong>1 cup</strong> coconut sugar or pure cane sugar* (192g)
            <br>
            <strong>6 tablespoons</strong> almond milk, room temp
            <br>
            <strong>2 teaspoons</strong> vanilla extract
            <br>
            <strong>1 cup</strong> flour (120g), spelt, unbleached all-purpose, almond flour, or 1-1 gluten-free blend
            <br>
            <strong>1 teaspoon</strong> baking soda**
            <br>
            <strong>A generous pinch</strong> of mineral salt (only use if nut butter is unsalted)
        </ol>
        <h6>*Reduce the sugar to ¾ cup for a less sweet cookie. It’s just as delicious!
        <br>
        **If you don’t have baking soda on hand, baking powder works great too. I tested many batches and they were just fine.</h6>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p class="instructions">
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with silicone mat, parchment paper or leave ungreased.
        <br>
        <br>
        Make the dough: In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla. Next, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, mix to combine. The dough will be tough to stir, using your hands to mix it together will be easier.
        <br>
        <br>
        Roll and flatten: Using a 1.5 tablespoon scooper, scoop out the dough and roll into balls, about 1 ¼ inch. Place the balls of dough about 2 ½ inches apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern. Optionally, sprinkle with sugar or coarse salt.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 10 – 13 minutes (13 minutes will yield a crispier cookie that’s tender inside). Let cool a few minutes, transfer cookies to wire rack and repeat with remaining dough.
        <br>
        <br>
        Makes 20 – 24 cookies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Store: Cookies can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for 5 days. They do well loosely covered on the counter for 2 – 3 days as well. To keep longer, store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
        <br>
        <br>
        To freeze: Let cookies cool completely, store in freezer safe container for up to 2 months.

    <h1>Sample Websites</h1>
    <h2>Recipe websites</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <p><li><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a></li></p>
        <p>I really appreciate the column layout of recipes on the home page, and its simplicity, focusing solely on images to bring the reader in. I think having small checkmarks next to the ingredients on teh site is visually pleasing and very organized, and I also like that step numbers in the instructions are large, bold and clear.</p>
        <p><li><a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly</a></li></p>
        <p>Yummly organizes their categories in beautiful simple shapes (circles at the top of the home page, and centered squares - rows of 3 - for recommended recipes). Their fonts are legible and sans-serif to bring attention to one more fancy font. Though this might be a little out of my range of abilities, they've got a wonderful scrolling tab where ingredients, like eggs, slowly move! </p>
        <p><li><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/">The kitchn</a></li></p>
        <p>I think this recipe page utilizes a lot of negative space on teh margins to organize the elements. It has a bold big image of the dish at teh top, similar to the other sites. The ingredients have a gray box around them to distinguish it which is nice! I think the hierarchy could be improved a bit more to make it even more clear.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Design websites</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li><a href="https://overtone.co/">Overtone</a></li></p>
        <p>I think I would like to try to incorporate boxes and columns like this website uses to organize my information. the clean lines that separate information also helps to communicate cleanly. I think that having a sticky bar at the top where you can click on "ingredients" or "instructions" will make my website even more user-friendly.</p>
        <p><li><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/essays/">The Met</a></li></p>
        <p>I appreciate the simplicity of this website as well, and if I was adding more than one recipe I would try to use the design of the filter tabs that this site uses. Most of the fonts are legible, but I do love the accent font for the logo and other small sections of types. Everything on the essays page is left-aligned and has equal sized images. It's an extremely legible layout overall.</p>
        <p><li><a href="https://www.are.na/explore">Are.na</a></li></p>
        <p>Are.na's website uses a 3-column design with boxes to divide content, and its gray aesthetic fades into the background to prioritize the displayed content. I want my overall website design to fade similar to this, so that teh recipe itself becomes the viewer's most easy to access, easy to focus on, object.</p>
