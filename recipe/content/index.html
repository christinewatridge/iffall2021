            <ingredients>
                <ol type:i>
                    <strong>1 cup</strong> natural peanut butter (270g), creamy or crunchy (or almond butter)
                    <br>
                    <strong>1 cup</strong> coconut sugar or pure cane sugar* (192g)
                    <br>
                    <strong>6 tablespoons</strong> almond milk, room temp
                    <br>
                    <strong>2 teaspoons</strong> vanilla extract
                    <br>
                    <strong>1 cup</strong> flour (120g), spelt, unbleached all-purpose, almond flour, or 1-1 gluten-free blend
                    <br>
                    <strong>1 teaspoon</strong> baking soda**
                    <br>
                    <strong>A generous pinch</strong> of mineral salt (only use if nut butter is unsalted)
                </ol>
                <h6>*Reduce the sugar to ¾ cup for a less sweet cookie. It’s just as delicious!
                <br>
                **If you don’t have baking soda on hand, baking powder works great too. I tested many batches and they were just fine.</h6>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p class="instructions">
                <number>1.</number>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with silicone mat, parchment paper or leave ungreased.
                <br>
                <br>
                <number>2.</number>Make the dough: In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla. Next, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, mix to combine. The dough will be tough to stir, using your hands to mix it together will be easier.
                <br>
                <br>
                <number>3.</number>Roll and flatten: Using a 1.5 tablespoon scooper, scoop out the dough and roll into balls, about 1 ¼ inch. Place the balls of dough about 2 ½ inches apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern. Optionally, sprinkle with sugar or coarse salt.
                <br>
                <br>
                <number>4.</number>Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 10 – 13 minutes (13 minutes will yield a crispier cookie that’s tender inside). Let cool a few minutes, transfer cookies to wire rack and repeat with remaining dough.
                <br>
                <br>
                Makes 20 – 24 cookies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Store: Cookies can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for 5 days. They do well loosely covered on the counter for 2 – 3 days as well. To keep longer, store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
                <br>
                <br>
                To freeze: Let cookies cool completely, store in freezer safe container for up to 2 months.
