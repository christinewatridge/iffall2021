      <ol type = "1">
        <h4 style="color:crimson;"><li> Provide your name, major, year in school. </li></h4>
            <p>Hello! My name is Christine Watridge, my two majors are ComDes and Art History, and I am a senior :)</p>
         <p>  </p>
         <h4 style="color:darkred;"> <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li></h4>
            <p>I consider myself a graphic designer usually working in InDesign and Illustrator. I am taking this class as a requirement but also because I really want to understand the basics of website coding and to learn new skills.</p>
         <p>  </p>
         <h4 style="color:purple;"> <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li> </h4>
            <p>I took Intro to CompSci in McKelvey sophomore year and was introduced to Java, where I worked on projects regarding if/then statements, arrays, recursion, objects, etc. I would say overall I have a basic understanding of those concepts but defintely would need a refresher!</p>
         <p>  </p>
         <h4 style="color:blueviolet;"> <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li> </h4>
            <p>I want to be able to make clickable titles and objects on a website that are animated in some way.Really, interactivity is an overall subject I want to experiment with.</p>
         <p>  </p>
         <h4 style="color:royalblue;"> <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li> </h4>
            <p>Designing for a screen is different because everybody's computer size and graohics ability is different, so websites open up and look different. The "composition" of a website shifts and it's important to keep that in mind.</p>
         <p>  </p>
         <h4 style="color:cornflowerblue;"> <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li> </h4>
            <p><a href = "https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/"> Frans Hals Museum</a>
            <p> I really like the design of this website because it's bold and vibrant without being distracting. The buttons to different tabs are cute icons and also very clear in their function. The fonts are specifically chosen to go with their museum. </p>
         <p>  </p>
         <h4 style="color:darkcyan;"> <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li> </h4>
         <p><p><a href = "https://www.ideo.com/blog"> Ideo's Blog </a></p>
            <p>I think this website demonstrates effective comunication. Its title and subtitle are bold and interact with the main illustration. Small sections of bright color enable the reader to find different categories of blog posts, and the composition of image to title, text and author feels very hierarchical in a good way. </p>
        <p>  </p>
        <h4 style="color:mediumseagreen;"> <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li> </h4>
            <p><p><a href = "https://www.zillow.com/"> Zillow </a></p>
            <p>Zillow's website employs very clear sections to communicate to the user where they can do different things. Also, the logo is centered on the page, along with a search bar below it to simply look up an address. Finally, below the large intro photo, they have 3 very clean-looking and clear boxes where you also have the option to pick your next step as a user. There is a font for headers, and a simpler font for the body text which makes the use of the website quick and easy. Its function as a house-hunting site is extermely functional while still employing aesthetics to highlight the different uses.</p>
