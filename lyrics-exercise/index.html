            <br>Green was the color of the grass
            <br>Where I used to read at Centennial Park  
            <br>I used to think I would meet somebody there    
            <br>Teal was the color of your shirt    
            <br>When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop    
            <br>You used to work at to make a little money    
                <br>
            <br><name class="name">[CHORUS]</name>
            <br>Time, curious time    
            <br>Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs   
            <br>Were there clues I didn't see?
            <br>And isn't it just so pretty to think      
            <br>All along there was some
            <br>Invisible string  
            <br>Tying you to me?  
            <br><ooh class="ooh">Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</ooh>

            <br>Bad was the blood of the song in the cab   
            <br>On your first trip to LA
            <br>You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
            <br>Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip   
            <br>Getting lunch down by the Lakes
            <br>She said I looked like an American singer   
                <br>
            <br><name class="name">[CHORUS]</name>   
            <br>Time, mystical time    
            <br>Cutting me open, then healing me fine   
            <br>Were there clues I didn't see?
            <br>And isn't it just so pretty to think      
            <br>All along there was some
            <br>Invisible string  
            <br>Tying you to me?

            <br>A string that pulled me    
            <br>Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar   
            <br>Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
            <br>Chains around my demons   
            <br>Wool to brave the seasons    
            <br>One single thread of gold   
            <br>Tied me to you  
                <br>
            <br><name class="name">[VERSE 3]</name>  
            <br>Cold was the steel of my axe to grind    
            <br>For the boys who broke my heart   
            <br>Now I send their babies presents   
            <br>Gold was the color of the leaves
            <br>When I showed you around Centennial Park    
            <br>Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven    
                <br>
            <br><name class="name">[CHORUS]</name>  
            <br>Time, wondrous time    
            <br>Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies 
            <br>And it's cool  
            <br>Baby, with me
            <br>Were there clues I didn't see?
            <br>And isn't it just so pretty to think      
            <br>All along there was some
            <br>Invisible string  
            <br>Tying you to me?

            <br>Me
